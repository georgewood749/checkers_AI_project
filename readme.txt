When opening the project, you will need to run the main.py file.

When you run main.py, a window will open up with a button to display the rules, and three buttons to select difficulty.

After selecting a difficulty, the game will begin, with the player being the black side and the AI being white. 

Black always makes the first move, so make a move, and after a short delay the AI will play their move, passing the turn back to you. 

The user can use drag and drop, or click-to-select/click-to-place functionality to move their pieces. When the user clicks to select or initiates the drag and drop, the legal moves that piece can make will be highlighted green on the board. The user can only make moves that have been highlighted for them. 

The game is played until one player has no more pieces remaining or the user quits.
